could not figure out opt algo if any
--
int findMaxDepth(const tnPtr& root)
--
nullptr
1 node
2 nodes
3 nodes

skewed - unbalanced
extemely deep
multiple paths at highest depth
--
Algo
depth=0 maxDepth = 0
Traverse tree using DFS (preorder - root, left, right)
	update depth for each level of depth
	when leaf node is reached, update maxDepth to depth if depth > maxDepth

O(N) time, O(N) space due to N levels of recursion
--
Optimized Algo
Ignore branches that terminate earlier than other branches.. how? 
--
Code

your algo above

GFG implementation

compare for a deep tree.. is there a diff?
--

createBT algo - better way to do it? 

In case of certain exceptions, std::cout << variableOfInterest << '\n'; stdout stream is not flushed. Use endl.

expressions like v[idx++] will become buggy in case you need to change code/logic. do ++idx as a separate statement.
